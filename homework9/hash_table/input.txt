She's got stickers on her locker
And the boy's number's there in magic marker
I'm hungry and the hunger will linger
I eat sixteen saltine crackers then I lick my fingers
Well every morning I deliver the news
Black hat white shoes and I'm red all over
She's got a big mailbox, that she puts up front
Garbage in, garbage out, she's getting what she wants
Who's jealous who's jealous who's jealous who's jealous of who?
If I get busy then I couldn't care less what you do
But when I'm by myself I think of nothing else
Than if a boy just might be getting through and touching you
Spike heels make a hole in a lifeboat
Jumpin' and weaving, I'm talking and laughing as we float
I hear a whistle, that's how I know she's home
Lipstick, eyelash, broke mirror, broken home
Force fed, force mixed 'till I drop dead
You can't defeat her, when you meet her you'll be what I said
And Lord knows there's a method to her madness
Bustin' those jokes as I float in a sea of sadness
She doesn't know but when she's gonna sit and drink up a few
I'm sure she's drinkin too, but wondering what for and who
And I'm solo rollin'. I'm one side off the boat.
Looking out, throwing up, a lifesaver down my throat
Who's jealous who's jealous who's jealous who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous who's jealous who's jealous who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous who's jealous who's jealous who's jealous of who?
